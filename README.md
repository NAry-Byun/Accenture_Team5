# Project Period
1st July - 4th July 2024 4days
# Value Proposition
This application is an innovative therapeutic tool designed for individuals suffering from depression. It helps users express and manage their emotions through art therapy techniques, promoting emotional stability and positive change.

# Target Market
It is primarily aimed at adults and adolescents experiencing depression or needing emotional support. Additionally, psychologists, counselors, and mental health professionals can use this tool to support their patients' treatment.

# Product Differentiation

User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface that anyone can easily use.
<br> Personalised Experience: Offers tailored content and activities to provide emotional support that meets individual needs.<br>
Daily Motivation: Upon completing daily tasks, users can assemble a puzzle image as a motivational reward. For those who do not enjoy drawing, they can play a musical instrument to complete a song instead.<br>
Expert Support: Integrates validated therapeutic techniques in collaboration with mental health professionals.<br>
Motivation and Monitoring: Unlike other depression and mental health products that are not popular and not designed for daily use, Mood Palette encourages users to regularly check their feelings and transfer their records to experts for better outcomes. This can be monetised through a subscription model after a trial period, making it accessible for teenagers who find it difficult to get psychiatric consultations, busy professionals, or those who are hesitant to meet doctors. It provides an easy consultation process that significantly helps mental health.
<br>Of course, there are concerns about accurate consultation and personal information security, which will be further reviewed in the future.
